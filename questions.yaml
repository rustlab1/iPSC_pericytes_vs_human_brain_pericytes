  You have been given bulk RNA-seq data comparing human primary brain vascular pericytes\
  to neural crest-derived iPSC pericytes (NCC-PC). Using the provided FASTQs and the\
  following pipeline (low count gene filtering 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  Log transformation 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  DESeq2),\
  answer the following:\
\
